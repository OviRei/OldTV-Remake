# OldTV but in javascript
i took the concept/game idea of the game "Old TV" but recreated it in javascript annnnnnnnd made it way worse :) 

### \**The web version (below) is no longer being worked on and has loads of bugs\**
#### \**I'm now working on an electron app for the game which the code for can be found in the electron branch\**
My version: https://ovirei.github.io/OldTV-Remake/

Original game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/643270/OLDTV/
